# Intent Classification with BiLSTM-CNN

This repository provides an implementation of an Intent Classification model using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is designed to classify user intents from natural language queries, making it suitable for chatbot and customer service applications.

## Overview

The intent classification model combines BiLSTM and CNN to capture both sequential and local features from text data. This approach enhances the model's ability to understand context and classify intents accurately.

### Features

- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Captures context from both past and future words.
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: Extracts local features and patterns from the text.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding, and embedding of text data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/modhudeb/Intent-classification-BiLSTM-CNN.git
   cd Intent-classification-BiLSTM-CNN
